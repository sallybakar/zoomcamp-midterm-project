### README: Diabetes Risk Prediction

---

#### Project Title:  
**Diabetes Risk Prediction**

---

#### Project Description:  
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the risk of diabetes in individuals based on various medical and lifestyle features. It uses patient data such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and family history to assess the likelihood of diabetes. The goal is to provide early detection and aid healthcare providers in decision-making.

---

#### Features:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze data distributions, relationships, and patterns in the dataset.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Clean and preprocess data, handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables.  
- **Model Training:** Train and evaluate machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
- **Deployment:** Provide a user-friendly interface to input data and get predictions (via a web app or API).  

---

#### Dataset:  
The dataset includes features such as:  
- Age  
- Gender  
- BMI  
- Blood Pressure  
- Glucose Levels  
- Insulin Levels  
- Physical Activity  
- Family History of Diabetes  

**Source:** [PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) or other clinical datasets.

#### Requirements:  
- **Python 3.8+**  
- Required libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn flask
  ```
